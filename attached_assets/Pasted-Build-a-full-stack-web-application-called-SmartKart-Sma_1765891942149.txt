Build a full-stack web application called “SmartKart – Smart Shopping Cart Software Prototype”.

CONTEXT:
This application is a SOFTWARE-ONLY prototype created to validate the logic of a Smart Shopping Cart system.
Hardware components such as barcode scanners, RFID readers, load cells, and BLE beacons are NOT physically connected.
Instead, their outputs are simulated through manual inputs to test the software layer independently.

TECH STACK:
- Backend: Python Flask
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Data storage: Local JSON file

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. Product Database
- Create a local JSON database containing products with fields:
  product_id, name, price, expected_weight (grams), category, aisle/location

2. Sensor Input Simulation
- Provide input fields for:
  - Product ID (simulating barcode/RFID scan)
  - Measured weight (simulating load cell input)
- Clearly label these fields as “Simulated Sensor Inputs” in the UI.

3. Weight Verification Logic
- When a product is added:
  - Compare measured_weight with expected_weight
  - Accept item only if difference ≤ ±50 grams
  - Reject item otherwise with an error message

4. Cart Management
- Maintain a cart list
- Allow adding and removing items
- Update total price in real time

5. Budget Control
- Allow user to set a shopping budget at the start
- Display:
  - Total spent
  - Remaining budget
- Show warning at 80% of budget
- Show alert when budget is exceeded

6. Navigation Assistance (SEPARATE SECTION)
- Create a dedicated “Product Navigation” section
- Display ALL available products (not only cart items)
- Show product name, category, and aisle/location
- Add:
  - Search bar
  - Category filter
- Selecting a product should display its aisle/location
- Mention that real-world deployment may use BLE beacons or indoor positioning

7. Billing & Checkout
- Generate a final digital bill listing:
  - Items
  - Individual prices
  - Total amount
- Simulate successful checkout (no payment gateway)
- Display invoice on screen

8. User Interface
- Simple, clean dashboard layout
- Sections:
  - Budget Setup
  - Simulated Item Scan
  - Cart Items
  - Product Navigation
  - Billing Summary
- Clear labels and alerts

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- All logic must run locally
- No external APIs
- Code should be readable and well-structured

DELIVERABLE:
- A runnable Flask application
- Clear separation of logic and UI
- Suitable for academic and patent review as a software implementation proof

Generate complete backend and frontend code.
